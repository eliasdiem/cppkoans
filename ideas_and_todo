- TC++PL 6.2.7 void
- TC++PL 6.2.8 sizes
- TC++PL 6.2.9 alignment
- TC++PL 7.2.1 void*
- TC++PL 10.3.1 Results: The result of sizeof is of an unsigned integral type called size_t defined in <cstddef>
- size_t (???) to address memory
- character types
 * char and character are 'not' the same thing
- conversions to T. They syntactically works always(?) with any type, i.e. also
  built-in
 * T(...)  
 * static_cast<T>(...)
 * (T)...
- TEST(introduction,know_your_implementations_type_info_name_scheme)
 * qualifiers: const, volatile, register, mutable, ...
